\section{RSs and the introduction of a Decision-Making paradox}

The original Decision-Making paradox was formally described by Triantaphyllou and Mann in 1989. Here, Triantaphyllou and Mann found that in order to determine the best decision-making method, you needed to know the best decision-making method.\\

The use of RSs introduces a Decision-Making paradox. Recommender systems deliver recommendations by using many different methods. In order to evaluate the best method for providing recommendations, according to the Decision-Making paradox, all methods need to be implemented for all RSs and tested.\\
